## **Project Overview**

This Django web application follows a modular design pattern, dividing functionality into separate apps (such as the `base` and `blog` apps). It uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling, offering utility-first CSS classes to build modern, responsive layouts.

---

## **Features**

- **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with apps like `base` and `blog`.
- **Template System**: Reusable HTML templates for rendering consistent layouts.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated for efficient, responsive UI design.
- **Database Migrations**: Handled with Django’s migration system.
- **Static Assets**: Custom CSS managed through static files.

---

## **Directory Structure**

The project has a clear and organized directory structure to maintain modularity and scalability.

```
├── base
│   ├── migrations         # Database migration files for the 'base' app
│   └── templates          # HTML templates for the 'base' app
│       └── base
│           └── partials   # Reusable template components (e.g., headers, footers)
├── blog                   # Blog application module
├── static
│   └── css                # Custom CSS files for styling
├── tailwind               # Tailwind CSS configuration and assets
└── templates              # Shared templates across the project
```

- **base**: Contains basic models, migrations, and templates for shared components like headers and footers.
- **blog**: Manages the blog functionality, including posts and related models.
- **static**: Stores custom static assets, such as CSS files.
- **tailwind**: Includes the configuration for Tailwind CSS, used for frontend design.
- **templates**: Holds global templates used by the entire project.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Django**: Web framework for building the backend of the application.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database management system (RDBMS) for storing application data.
- **Gunicorn**: Python WSGI HTTP server for hosting the application.
- **Uvicorn**: ASGI server for handling asynchronous requests.

## **Setup Instructions**

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Install the required Python dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Configure Database Settings**

Ensure your database URI is correctly set in the `.env` file (for environment variable management), or configure it in `settings.py`:

```bash
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.config(default=config('DB_URI'), conn_max_age=600)
}
```

### 5. **Apply Migrations**

Run the migrations to set up your database schema:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. **Collect Static Files**

Gather all static files into a single location for serving:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 7. **Run the Development Server**

Now you can run the development server to view the application locally:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

---

## **Usage**

### **Running the Application**

To run the application in production, you can use **Gunicorn** (for WSGI apps) with **Uvicorn** (for ASGI):

```bash
gunicorn mysite.asgi:application -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker
```

### **Tailwind CSS Configuration**

1. Tailwind CSS is integrated into the project.
2. To compile Tailwind, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will compile your CSS and ensure that the required styles are applied.
